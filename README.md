# Black-Friday-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project

This project looks at Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Black Friday sales dataset to understand customer purchasing behavior and sales patterns. The main goal was to analyze historical sales data and pull out useful insights that can help businesses improve their sales strategies.

I began the project by examining the dataset’s structure and cleaning the data. I identified and addressed missing values, inconsistent entries, and incorrect data types using Python and Pandas. This step improved the overall quality of the dataset before analysis.

After cleaning the data, I conducted a detailed analysis of customer demographics, including age, gender, marital status, and occupation, as well as product categories and purchase amounts. I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize spending patterns across different age groups, genders, and product categories. These visualizations made it easier to spot which customer segments contribute the most to sales.

Through this project, I learned how to analyze customer behavior using data, interpret visual insights, and draw conclusions from large datasets. The skills I gained can be applied in future roles related to data analytics, marketing analysis, and business decision-making.
